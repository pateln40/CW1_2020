I attemped to make AI for my game, this involved using the **NevMeshAgent** and **Baking** function . This allows the AI to move around the map that is walkable, and the walls that isn't walkable, since my game is in a maze the AI needs to move around the map without it bumping into the walls, I also made the AI to move at certain points as well so that it can move in a certain area rather than the whole map, since I plan to make more than one AI in my scene. I did have some issues with the waypoints, the AI wouldn't face in the right direction, but I just redid the waypoints and it worked.

  First time creating 3D animation in Unity for a game, I needed my character to move up down, left, right and down. Struggled to get the animation to move with the animations smoothly. The character would move in all directions but it would bounce back to the original position which is unnatural. I finally fixed the issue and now the player moves without bouncing back and the animations seems to work well. 
  
  
  
  void Start()
    {
        myAnimator = GetComponent<Animator>();
       
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKey("w") || Input.GetKey ("s") || Input.GetKey ("a") || Input.GetKey ("d"))
        {
            myAnimator.SetBool("istheplayermoving", true);
        }
        else
        if (!Input.GetKey("w") || Input.GetKey ("s") || Input.GetKey ("a") || Input.GetKey ("d"))
        {
            myAnimator.SetBool("istheplayermoving", false);
        }
        

    }

   
The code for the player to move in all directions. 

      float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        if (moveX != 0 || moveZ != 0)
        {
            modelTransform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(new Vector3(moveX, 0f, moveZ));

        }

    Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveX, 0f, moveZ);
        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = movement * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
        }

There was an issue with one of the scripts when the player collected the honey, the UI wouldn’t go down to 0 instead it would stay at 1. The UI should’ve countdown from 5 to 0, which would show how many collectables they had left. This is what the script was like before.

    public void UpdateUI() 
    {
        if (cur_coins > 0)
        {
            coinsLeft.text = "Honey" + cur_coins.ToString ("D");
            Door.SetActive (true);

It was something I couldn’t ignore because the player wouldn’t know if they collected all  objects in the maze.
I gave up and returned the next day to think of why it wouldn’t work since the script looked fine, however I realised that I missed a couple of lines of code.  And this finally made the UI Countdown to 0 and trigger the door. Small error but I realised it and it made sense why the UI wasn't counting down properly.

  
    public void UpdateUI() 
    {
        if (cur_coins > 0)
        {
            coinsLeft.text = "Honey" + cur_coins.ToString ("D");

        }
        else if (cur_coins <= 0) {
            coinsLeft.text = "Honey" + cur_coins.ToString ("D");
            Door.SetActive (true);
        }

Created a script to trigger an image when the player goes near an object (collider), it was meant to be a board sign for the player to read the instructions of the game. A simple code but I made a small mistake again, I spelt 'enabled' wrong, took me a while to find it but I got there in the end. 

{
    [SerializeField] private RawImage customImage;

    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            customImage.enabled = true;
        }
    }

    void OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            customImage.enabled = false;
        }
    }
